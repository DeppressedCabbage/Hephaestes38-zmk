Hephaestes38 is a custom, 38 key, low profile, split unibody keyboard. I Intended it to be used with the Hands Down promethium layout, but that's really up to you!

It's programmed on a Nice!Nano for wireless functonality, as well as compatibility for a Nice!View E-paper display to keep track of layers, battery status, or whatever else suits your fancy.

### PCB's
All files to make your own pcb's can be found in the pcb's and cases folder. The Hepheaestes38_PCB-Gerbers.zip can be uploaded into any pcb manufacturer to get them made, and all of the kicad files are available if you want to make any edits. 

***
### BOM

Additionally, you'll also need the following

- 38x SMD or Through Hole diodes (1N4148W or 1N4148)
- 38x Kailh Choc Hotswap Sockets
- 38x Kailh Choc V1 Switches
- 1x Nice!Nano
- 2× Pair of headers and sockets for the N!N (I used the easy solder machine headers, but mil-max sockets will work just fine too)
- (optional) 1x Nice!View
- (optional) 1x Lipo battery (301230)
- (optional) 1x Power switch (PCM12)
- (optional) 1x Reset switch (PTS526)
- (optional) Rubber feet to stop the keyboard sliding around (I used 3mm by 10mm ones, but if you aren't using a case it shouldn't matter much)

***
### Firmware

Hepheaestes38 runs ZMK, you can modify and compile you're own firmware by cloning the repo and maiking any edits you like. 

*** 
### To Do List

- Create Case
- Add via's to the pcb to facilitate Case attachement
- Refine Pcb to allow for diode attachment on both sides, along with turning Diode Footprint around
- Lower profile?

### Credits

This is my first foray into making my own keyboard, so special thanks go out to the entire ergo community, notably 

- [FlatFootFox](https://twitter.com/flatfootfox) - for the guide to ergogen
- [Ceoloide](https://github.com/ceoloide) - For the footprints used in creating the pcb
- [Lesshonor](https://github.com/lesshonor) - For helping me out with the getting the display to work
- And my lovely offline support system for moral support and encouragement.
