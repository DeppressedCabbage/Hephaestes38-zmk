<h1 align="left">Hephaestes38</h1>

Hephaestes38 is a custom, 38 key, low profile, split unibody keyboard. I Intended it to be used with the Hands Down promethium layout, but that's really up to you! ZMK studio has also been integrated, so it's super easy to make any changes you wish. I only use 3 Layers, but the firmware has a total of 5 for you to add any you like.

It's programmed on a Nice!Nano for wireless functonality, as well as compatibility for a Nice!View E-paper display to keep track of layers, battery status, or whatever else suits your fancy.

### PCB's
All files to make your own pcb's can be found in the pcb's and cases folder. The Hepheaestes38_PCB-Gerbers.zip can be uploaded into any pcb manufacturer to get them made, and all of the kicad files are available if you want to make any edits. 

***
### BOM

Additionally, you'll also need the following

- 38x SMD or Through Hole diodes (1N4148W or 1N4148)
- 38x Kailh Choc Hotswap Sockets
- 38x Kailh Choc V1 Switches
- 1x Nice!Nano
- 2× Pair of headers and sockets for the N!N (I used the easy solder machine headers, but mil-max sockets will work just fine too)
- (optional) 1x Nice!View
- (optional) 1x Lipo battery (301230)
- (optional) 1x Power switch (PCM12)
- (optional) 1x Reset switch (PTS526)
- (optional) Rubber feet to stop the keyboard sliding around (I used 3mm by 10mm ones, but if you aren't using a case it shouldn't matter much)

***
### Firmware

Hepheaestes38 runs ZMK, you can modify and compile you're own firmware by cloning the repo and maiking any edits you like. 

*** 
### V1 Case

This is the first version of they keyboard, and I forgot to add mounting holes to the pcb to facilitate Case attachement. I worked around this in a less than elegant way, and if you want to make v1 you would have to do something similar. Pictures are below.

### To Do List

- ✔Create Case
- Add via's to the pcb to facilitate Case attachement
- Refine Pcb to allow for diode attachment on both sides, along with turning Diode Footprint around
- Lower profile?
- ✔ Add zmk Studio support

### Credits

This is my first foray into making my own keyboard, so special thanks go out to the entire ergo community, notably 

- [FlatFootFox](https://twitter.com/flatfootfox) - for the guide to ergogen
- [Ceoloide](https://github.com/ceoloide) - For the footprints used in creating the pcb
- [Lesshonor](https://github.com/lesshonor) - For helping me out with the getting the display to work
- And my lovely offline support system for moral support and encouragement.
